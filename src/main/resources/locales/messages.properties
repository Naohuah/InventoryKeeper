  Item Configuration\n\
  \n\
  ********************\n\
  This configuration file is to set the custom items use to keep players' inventory.\n\
  You can set multiple items. A higher priority item will be consumed first in players' inventory on death to keep their inventory.\n\
  Here is an example of the custom item:\n\
    #Group name\n\
    special-amulet:\n\
      #The display name that will show in plugin commands. (Not the real item name)\n\
      name: 'Ancient amulet'\n\
      # In 1.13-, number and Sub-id(item damage) is accepted.\n\
      # Accepted examples: 273, '397:3', 'SKULL_ITEM:3', PLAYER_HEAD, 'WOOL:4' \n\
      item-id: PLAYER_HEAD\n\
      # TO use custom head texture, add it. (Optional)\n\

      custom-model-data: 1\n\
      # The display name of the item, remove this if you want to use vanilla item. (Optional)\n\
      item-name: '&aAncient amulet'\n\
      # The lore of the item. Remove it if not needed. (Optional)\n\
      item-lore:\n\

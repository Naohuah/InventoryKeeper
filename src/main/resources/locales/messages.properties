InventoryKeeper Config\n\
   \n\
*************************\n\
Admin permission: inventorykeeper.admin  The plugin only works when the world gamerule keepInventory is false.\n\
  Configuration guide：\n\
\n\
If the keeping inventory item is a block, this will prevent players from placing it. Default: true\n\
prevent-placing-the-item: true\n\
  Display the death cause of a player in console. (Debug option)  Default: false\n\
  show-death-cause-on-death: false\n\
  If you are running on a modded server with Galacticraft mod installed, turn it on to keep galacticraft inventory. Default: false\n\
  galacticraft-mod-support: false\n\
  \n\
  Execute commands on death if a player dies without keeping the inventory\n\
  Command usage：%player% for the player name，%random% for a random number if needed\n\
  To use random number in a command, the format should be： minimum|maximum|commands\n\
  To run a command as OP, add [OP] on the head of a command.\n\
  To disable it, leave it empty. eg: run-commands-on-death-if-drops: []\n\
  Example:\n\
  run-commands-on-death-if-drops:\n\
  - '[OP]fly off'\n\
  - '10|200|eco take %player% %random%'\n\
  \n\
  When player died without keeping the inventory, one of command groups will be chose randomly and executed.Same usage as above\n\
  Mulitple commands is supported, use ";" to separate multiple commands, don't ADD ANY SPCAES after ";"\n\
  Examples: （To disable, leave it empty： run-random-commands-on-death-if-drops: []）\n\
  run-random-commands-on-death-if-drops:\n\
  - 10|50|eco take %player% %random%;tell %player% You lost %random% coins!\n\
  - 1|10|eco give %player% %random%;tell %player% You gained %random% coins!\n\
  \n\
  Execute commands on respawn if a player dies without keeping the inventory.\n\
  Examples:\n\
  run-commands-on-respawn-if-drops:\n\
  - '15|90|effect %player% minecraft:nausea %random% 1'\n\
  \n\
  When player died without keeping the inventory, one of command groups will be chose randomly and executed on respawn. Same usage as above.\n\
  Examples:\n\
  run-random-commands-on-respawn-if-drops:\n\
  - 15|90|effect %player% minecraft:weakness %random% 1\n\
  - 15|30|effect %player% minecraft:strength %random% 1\n\
  - 15|30|effect %player% minecraft:resistance %random% 1
